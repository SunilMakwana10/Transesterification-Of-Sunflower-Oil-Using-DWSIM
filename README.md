# Transesterification-Of-Sunflower-Oil-Using-DWSIM
A steady state simulation for production of Biodiesel by transesterification of Sunflower Oil using DWSIM

The conversion data with respect to catalyst loading ratio and reaction temperature and pressures were obtained from literature by this paper: Bambase, Manolito & Nakamura, Nobuyuki & Tanaka, Junko & Matsumura, Masatoshi. (2007). Kinetics of hydroxide‐catalyzed methanolysis of crude sunflower oil for the production of fuel‐grade methyl esters. Journal of Chemical Technology and Biotechnology. 82. 273 - 280. 10.1002/jctb.1666. 

The composition of sunflower oil was obtained from literature and the components were added to the simulation. The compounds which were not available were added using their JSON files.

The simulation was done on DWSIM an open source simulation software as follows
